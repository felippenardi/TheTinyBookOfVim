TheTinyBookOfVim
================

Soon to be a book about Vim Normal Mode commands

## Content
 The idea of this book is cover all basic Normal Mode commands.

 Each letter will be a page, and the book is intended to become a free online and [Little Printer](http://littleprinter.com) publication.

## How to collaborate
All the content of the book will be constructed on json files, so it can later be parsed and processed by javascript.

The idea is that we cover all letters, from A to Z, so you can jump in and add a json file of a letter that does not exist using an existing one as reference.

I'd love to send each contributor a physic copy of this Tiny Book when it is ready. :)
